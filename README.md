IT professional since 2000, I acquired knowledge in technologies considered "legacy" today, but that was the basis for maturity and consolidation in the career of technologist.
For 10 years, I supported critical application environments of the Brazilian financial system, industry, telecommunications and retail, with complex integration and messenger.
Currently I work as a delivery manager after consolidating my career as a software engineer, developing Cloud Native (CNCF) applications with Java, JakartaEE and MicroProfile specifications. Enthusiastic about agile philosophy and customer focus.
